# Synapse AI Engine Kernel

Welcome to Synapase Robotics OS Kernel main repository

## Overview

Synapse Robotics aims to make robotics more user friendly while not sacrificing hardware potential especially for AI applications

There exists many other boards and tools out there (most known are BeagleBone or Raspberry PI with Linux)
The downsise of those approaches is that the hardware is not specialized and optimized for a hardware architecture and AI

Synapse Robotics aims to be adapted to ARM architecture while keeping in mind AI optimization integration in the kernel thus facilitating
entry points for newcomers and making it cost less than alternatives.
